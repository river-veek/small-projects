# Here, I will upload various personal projects that are not large enough to merit their own repository.

## Contents

chaos_game.py
- Implementation of the chaos game; iteratively creating a fractal.

summation_error.py
- Calculating the sum of n^p from n = 1 to n = infinity. Allows the user to enter the percent error, d, and the telescoping exponent, p.









## Updates
